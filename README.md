# Yahs All-in-one Calender Application
Self runnning (independent), always accessible application, that informs and teaches people about Yah's appointed Tmes and Seasons, based on the Sun, Moon (and Stars). The Application is Geo-location dependant and self adeptive. It is centrally governed by the Appointed Kings, High Priests, Priests and Watchmen. Yet flexible enough to accompany contract-based differences in the process of synchronisation and unification of the Hebrew Israelite Nations & other Nations of the world, that wish to proselyte.

## Nu Humans - No Calendar
In Contrast to all other DateTime Systems, Yah's Children are an indispensable part of DateTime keeping and DateTime observence. Without Yah's Children there is no Calendar.

## Unity in Diversity
The Calendar Application allows integration and insight into both General and Kingdom/group/tribe specific feasts and customs on their specific Appointed Times. The application should not only be a passive provider of information but should also actively alert & update users depending on their specifi needs.

## Extend DateTime Functions in all Languages
In it's Simplest core form it should (eventually replace but) for now extend the DateTime function of any (system) language. but as a matter of growth process start with adding a new format to the DateTime functions. Users should be able to choose their Computer, Tablet, Phone or any other System to tell Yah's Time and Date. 

## API?
Send Human/System DateTime -> Return Yah's DateTime
